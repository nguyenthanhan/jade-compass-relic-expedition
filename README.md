- **Mistral (AI SDK)**: Mistral models with AI SDK features
- **OpenRouter (AI SDK)**: OpenRouter models with AI SDK support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Next.js 15 Features

- **App Router**: Modern file-based routing with nested layouts
- **Server Components**: Improved performance with server-side rendering
- **Streaming**: Progressive loading for better user experience
- **Turbopack**: Faster development builds (when available)
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization and WebP support
- **Font Optimization**: System font stack with fallbacks

### Provider Adapter Pattern

The game uses an adapter pattern for LLM providers, making it easy to add new AI providers. Each provider implements a consistent interface for generating game events. Currently supports OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, and Groq, plus AI SDK variants for enhanced functionality.

### Error Handling & User Experience

All LLM providers feature improved error handling that provides clear, actionable error messages to users. When testing connections or generating content fails, users receive meaningful feedback instead of cryptic error codes. This includes:

- **Connection Testing**: Clear feedback when API keys are invalid or network issues occur
- **Content Generation**: Descriptive error messages for rate limits, model issues, or API failures
- **Fallback System**: Automatic fallback to offline mode with user notification
- **Debugging Support**: Enhanced logging for developers while maintaining user privacy

### Narrative State Management

Story continuity is maintained through a minimal state object containing location, status, and items. The state evolves with each choice, creating a cohesive adventure narrative.

### Fallback System

- Primary: Connected LLM provider
- Fallback: Offline event pool with 8+ unique scenarios
- Automatic fallback on timeout (10s) or error

### Code Architecture

- **Component Refactoring**: Home page split into smaller, maintainable components
- **Custom Hooks**: `useSettings` hook for centralized settings management
- **Constants Management**: Centralized provider data and model lists
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript types and interfaces

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Streamlined Model Selection**: Simplified model lists with clean, minimal interface
- **Integrated Test Button**: Test connection button positioned in the modal footer for better workflow
- **Enhanced Visual Design**: Improved button styling with destructive cancel button and secondary test button
- **Better Accessibility**: Improved focus management and visual feedback
- **Introduction Card**: Detailed gameplay instructions and tips
- **Auto-save**: Settings automatically saved when changed

## üé® Features

- **Retro Pixel-Art Style**: Authentic 2D pixel-art aesthetic with custom animations
- **Multiple Endings**: Victory screen with Vietnamese easter egg, detailed failure summaries
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management
- **Secrets Handling**: API keys stored in browser localStorage for convenience
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on desktop and mobile devices with Next.js 15 optimizations
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when LLM services are unavailable
- **Modern Web Standards**: Built with the latest Next.js 15 features and React 19+ capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Key Technologies

- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router, Server Components, and latest optimizations
- **React 19+**: Latest React features with concurrent rendering
- **TypeScript 5+**: Type-safe development with latest language features
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first styling with custom CSS variables and JIT compilation
